# My Structure - Student 04

## What I See in My Data
    1
   2-2
  3-3-3
 4-4-4-4
TYPE: PYRAMID
COLOR: YELLOW

## What I Think This Means
The data shows a layered structure where each row increases in width as it moves downward. The top level contains one unit, followed by rows of two, three and four units respectively. The spacing centres each row, creating a symmetrical triangular shape. This matches the description of a pyramid structure.

## What This Could Be
This could be a small pyramid-shaped climbing structure in a playground. The increasing width at each level suggests steps or tiers that children could climb, while the symmetrical design would help with balance and stability.

## Questions I Have
- Is the pyramid designed to be climbed from all sides or only from the front?
- Does the increase in width represent safety requirements for stability?
- Is the colour yellow intended to improve visibility or indicate a specific play function?
